"""The Settings pages' layout model (tools/pod_pages.py cards pages, docs/modules/settings.md "Cards"): iOS-style grouped cards in the stock list.

tools/pod_ui.py builds the widget trees from these numbers, tools/preview_settings.py draws the design from them and test/pod/settings.py checks the built
trees against them (with demo's own layouter), so the mock, the tests and the device share one set of numbers.

The stock list_view layouter ignores a child's y: it stacks every visible child of the scroll_view in child order, from y 0, setting x (0) and the width and summing the heights
into virtual_h. So the page is a column of full-width items, each as high as the model says: a CM spacer, then rows (ROW_H), headers (HDR_H), notes (NOTE_H) and gaps (GAP_H) in
the order of the page's layout, then an END_H spacer. There are no card views: a card is drawn by its rows, each of which has a picture as its background (single / top / middle /
bottom piece, ROW_W x ROW_H, tools/mod_icons.py card_piece) with the card's x CM .. CM + CARD_W, its corners (CARD_R, only where the piece needs them) and its fill baked in and
transparent outside (the pressed pieces are lit). A hairline (CARD_HAIR_RGB) is a child of the row from the label to the card's right edge, on every row but a card's last. Coordinates
below are row relative (x 0 is the list's left edge, so a card starts at CM). The 20 px glyph (GLYPH_PX in a 24 px image) is centred in a 20 px column PAD from the card's edge, the label
starts LABEL_GAP after the column (a picker row has no glyph: PAD). On the right, the ink of the chevron, the switch and the check ends PAD from the card's edge; a value is grey, 8 px
left of the chevron. A header is secondary grey and a note smaller grey text; their labels start at HDR_X, the left of the glyph column's ink.
