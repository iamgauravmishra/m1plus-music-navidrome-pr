"""The geometry of M1+ Music's own QWERTY keyboard (patch/keyboard.c, docs/modules/keyboard.md), in one place.

tools/pod_ui.py builds ui/m1plus_keyboard.bin from it (the lowercase page), the tests check every page's widget moves in the payload against it,
and tools/preview_keyboard.py draws all pages from it. patch/keyboard.c repeats the arithmetic (x0 = (320 - n w - (n - 1) 3 + 1) / 2) and the strings;
test/pod/keyboard.py compares the two.

iPhone OS 1 proportions on the M1 Plus' 320 px screen: the pad is 180 px high at the bottom of the window (450 px under the 30 px status bar: the
bottom of the 480 px screen), 6 px of padding above and under four rows at a 44 px pitch, keys 36 px high. Letter keys are 29 px wide with 3 px
gaps (ten across: 317 px, a margin of 1.5 px: 2 on the left, 1 on the right), rows of nine and seven are centred, shift and delete are 40 wide at the
edges, the bottom row is 123 (74), space (163) and Search (74).
