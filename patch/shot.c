/* M1+ Music Screenshot: a developer's screen grab from the Extras page (docs/architecture.md "Screenshot").
 *
 * Copyright (c) 2026 Xin. MIT licence (see LICENSE).
 *
 * A tap on the Screenshot row (Customize > Developer) asks in the stock confirm dialog; Yes starts a payload-owned countdown (SHOT_SECONDS, one stock timer, so the user can
 * leave the page and go where the picture should be), shows a camera in the status bar while it runs, and then
 * writes what is on the panel to /mnt/mmc/screenshots/shot-NNNN.bmp (24 bit, bottom-up). No stock function is
 * hooked and nothing runs unless that row was tapped: no thread, no paint hook, no main loop work; the timers exist only
 * between the tap and the toast that ends the capture.
 *
 * The grab reads the frame buffer, the one thing that is exactly what is on screen (status bar, dialogs, Cover Flow's
 * own drawing). Stock opens /dev/fb0 in lcd_linux_fb_create (0x6393dc) and learns the format with FBIOGET_VSCREENINFO
 * and FBIOGET_FSCREENINFO (0x4600, 0x4602); the payload does the same on its own descriptor and maps the same memory
 * read-only, and reads the visible buffer (yoffset, which FBIOPAN_DISPLAY moves when the lcd is double buffered). The
 * format is never assumed: 16, 24 or 32 bits per pixel with the channel positions the driver reports (stock picks its
 * lcd_mem_* class from the same fields); anything it cannot read exactly is a failure, never a wrong picture.
 * widget_take_snapshot_rect (0x671cb8) was the alternative: it repaints the widget tree into a new bitmap instead of
 * reading the screen, so dialogs, the status bar and the pages' own after-paint drawing depend on which widget is
 * handed in.
 *
 * Order of a capture: the last countdown tick hides the status bar camera (widget_set_visible invalidates it), and
 * the grab runs from a second one-shot SHOT_SETTLE_MS later, so the main loop has repainted the bar and the frame
 * buffer no longer holds it; only then is the card checked (mounted, SHOT_MIN_FREE_MB free), the frame written to
 * a temp file, fsynced and renamed, and the toast shown (after the grab, so it is not in the picture). Every
 * failure leaves no partial file and ends in a toast; the camera is hidden on every path.
