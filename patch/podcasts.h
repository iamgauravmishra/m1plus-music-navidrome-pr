 * docs/modules/podcasts.md has the design, the file formats and the approximations.
 *
 * ONE module makes the episode list of a show (pc_load_show): the files on the card, merged with the metadata file the subscribe phase will write
 * (.episodes: one line per episode), sorted newest first. The RSS client of the next phase feeds the same list by writing that file; nothing in the
 * page knows where an episode came from. An episode has a state: PC_LOCAL (the file is on the card), PC_PART (a download under way), PC_REMOTE (known,
 * not downloaded). P0 shows PC_LOCAL only.
