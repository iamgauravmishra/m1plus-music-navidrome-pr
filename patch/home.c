/* M1+ Music as Home: the boot guard and the launcher. docs/architecture.md has the design and the
 * recovery plan.
 *
 * Copyright (c) 2026 Xin. MIT licence (see LICENSE). The crash marker follows q2-pod's design.
 *
 * This is the only payload code that runs at start-up. One stock function is hooked for it,
 * home_page_init (0x534cd4, called once through the navigator's page-init dispatcher when the Home
 * window is created). The hook runs the stock function to completion first, then home_boot():
 *
 *   1. state = OFF (stock behaviour) until everything below has succeeded;
 *   2. a kill-switch file (SD or flash) -> stop;
 *   3. the crash marker /mnt/data/m1plus-run exists -> the previous attempt never proved itself:
 *      write the sticky bad note, switch the setting to Shanling, remove the marker (if the note
 *      cannot be written the marker stays, so the next boot is stock too) and stop;
 *   4. the bad note exists -> stop;
 *   5. write the marker (temp file, fsync, rename, directory fsync); any failure -> stop;
 *   6. arm: a one-shot UI timer removes the marker CLEAR_MS later (the boot completed);
 *   7. add the "M1+ Music" icon to the stock grid (whatever the setting says; a failure adds nothing),
 *      register a Home "to foreground" handler (it re-adds the icon if the stock code rebuilt the grid) and,
 *      when the setting says M1+ Music, schedule the first pod-menu open.
 *
 * A Shanling start is armed too (marker, clear timer) because the icon is new code on the boot path; it
 * only opens nothing. Every failure path leaves the stock Home as it was. The kill switch and the setting are checked again before every later open.
