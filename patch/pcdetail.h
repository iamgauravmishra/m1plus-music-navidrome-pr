 * description wrapped once (patch/pcwrap.c: kinsoku, CJK anywhere) from the font's own advances, the blocks' tops, and paints them. tools/pod_show.py `detail_layout` is the same layout in Python
 * (it reads the PD_* numbers below): the tests and the preview use it. Content y from the list's top (window row 50).
