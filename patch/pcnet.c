/* M1+ Music Podcasts on the network: import, refresh one show or all (docs/modules/podcasts.md "Feeds").
 *
 * Copyright (c) 2026 Xin. MIT licence (see LICENSE).
 *
 * See patch/pcnet.h. One detached worker thread per job: for each show it reads the show file's feed url, streams the feed through libcurl into the push parser (patch/pcfeed.c;
 * verification ON with the CA bundle on the card, redirects followed, gzip accepted, time-outs and a size cap on every request), then writes .episodes and .show atomically (a temp file,
 * fsync, rename) and records the result. The thread touches no widget and calls no stock function; the status record is plain words the page reads on its own timer (a store barrier
 * before the generation counter moves). Only demo's own imports are used (libcurl's easy interface, pthread_create / pthread_detach, open / write / fsync / rename / access).
 *
 * Episode downloads (pn_dl_*, "Downloads" below) run on a thread of their own, one episode at a time, beside whatever job runs (pcnet.h "Two lanes"). The download policy follows q2-podcasts (MIT licence,
 * github.com/m-d-e-v/q2-podcasts): chunked writes, Range resume, stall limit, retries after 10, 20 and 40 s, a 32 MB free-space margin. The code is our own.
