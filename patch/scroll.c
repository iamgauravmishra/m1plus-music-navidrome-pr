/* M1+ Music list gestures: a swipe never plays a song, and a touch on a coasting list stops it.
 *
 * Copyright (c) 2026 Xin. MIT licence (see LICENSE).
 *
 * Every stock list is list_view > scroll_view > list_item rows. The stock code (docs/architecture.md, "List gestures")
 * has two holes. (1) A row cancels its press (and the scroll_view cancels it for every child) only when a MOVE crosses
 * the 10 px threshold. The scroll_view sees the pointer-up after its rows: a release far from the press with no MOVE
 * past the threshold in between (sparse touch samples in a quick flick) reaches the row as a click while the list
 * flings. (2) A touch on a list that is still animating its fling presses and clicks the row under the finger, and the
 * drag that follows cannot move the list until the animation ends.
 *
 * One hook, and no code of the stock app is overwritten: the on_event_before_children slot of g_scroll_view_vtable
 * (0x97a330, zero in stock), which widget_on_event_before_children (0x666c34) calls for every pointer event of a
 * scroll_view before the event goes down to its children. It runs only for touches inside a scroll_view; never at boot,
 * in paint or in the main loop. A MOVE costs two compares. No allocation, no syscall, no log: the kill switch
 * (/mnt/mmc/m1plus-off, or the flash one) is read once, at the first DOWN or UP, and the hook is a no-op for a session
 * that starts with it.
 *
 *  DOWN on a scroll_view whose scroll animator is running: the animator is destroyed and the stock end-of-animation
 *  handler runs (wa cleared, the end events), then the scroll_view takes the press itself (widget_dispatch: grab,
 *  velocity, press position) and the event is stopped, so the rows below never see this DOWN. The rest of the gesture
 *  is stock: a drag scrolls from here, a plain tap does nothing (the row was never pressed, so its UP is no click).
 *  UP after the finger moved the threshold from where it came down, without the stock MOVE path having noticed
 *  (dragged is still 0): the same EVT_POINTER_DOWN_ABORT the stock MOVE path sends, before the rows see the UP, so the
 *  row that was pressed drops its press and the release is no click.
 * The threshold is the stock one and the stock axes: slidable ones only, so a horizontal drag inside a vertical list (a
 * slider in a settings row) is left alone; a scroll_view that snaps to pages is left to stock.
