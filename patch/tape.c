/* M1+ Music Tape: a landscape, fullscreen cassette Now Playing page.
 *
 * Copyright (c) 2026 Xin. MIT licence (see LICENSE).
 *
 * docs/modules/tape.md has the design. The page is ui/m1plus_tape.bin (tools/pod_ui.py build_tape_page): a fullscreen window (320 x 480, the stock status bar is not drawn) holding
 * one view tape_view (the whole window: the touch target, painted by this file in its own EVT_AFTER_PAINT) and a hidden label that only carries the font. Like the Pod
 * (patch/ipod.c) it has no hook, no widget per thing drawn, one page-scoped timer set in place with timer_modify, and nothing at boot.
 *
 *   picture   LANDSCAPE, 480 x 320, on the portrait panel: the picture is turned 90 degrees clockwise into a 320 x 480 RGBA frame this file owns, so landscape (x, y) is the frame's
 *             row x, column 319 - y (tp_pix), the map Cover Flow's landscape captions use (patch/coverflow.c). The frame starts as tape_shell with the grain and the knurl laid on (tp_finish; the cassette, no text), and only what
 *             changes is drawn into it: the tape packs and hub sprites (the timer), the printed marks (the timer) and the text (the paint, which has the canvas and so the font). The
 *             paint blits the frame 1:1; the timer invalidates only the rectangle that changed.
 *   text      the device font's glyph alpha (font_get_glyph) blended into the frame through the same map: AWTK's text drawing does not rotate, this does not need it (Cover Flow's
 *             landscape captions are the precedent, on the device). Each field restores its rectangle from the shell and clips the glyphs to it.
 *   reels     tape_top (the holes' rings, the window's scale and bevel) over a tape pack drawn per pixel (a distance table, integer) over the shell; tape_hubs: 12 frames. A pack
 *             is redrawn when its radius changes (position / length: the area of tape is conserved), a hub only when its frame (5 degrees) changes.
 *   touch     taps only, mapped back to landscape: a tap on the top left screw (50 x 50 px, drawn darker and turned while it is held) closes the page, a tap anywhere else plays /
 *             pauses. The page registers pointer DOWN, UP and ABORT only: no MOVE, no grab, so the window manager's own touch hook (the pull-down from the top edge) sees every
 *             drag as it does on any other page.
