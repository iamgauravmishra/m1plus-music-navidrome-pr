/* Navidrome downloads (docs/modules/subsonic.md "Data and cache", "File split"): ONE detached download worker, a queue whose rows wait on the card (dlq.idx), the manifest dl.idx of finished downloads and the
 * target files in SBA_MUSIC_DIR. The pages never block here: sba_dl_add posts the track and returns, the worker writes the file (sbn_download: a .part file, a Range resume, the PR's
 * stall limit of 512 B/s for 45 s and the 32 MB free-space floor), appends the manifest row, and the page's timer reads sba_dl_gen / sba_dl_state.
 * The worker never calls AWTK; the stock functions it calls are the library scan of a finished album's folder (scanSpecFolder, as the PR does after a DSD file) and, through sba_guard at the start of a download, get_wifisignal (the Wi-Fi check; sba_configured reads the saved login).
 *
 * Who owns what (patch/m1job.h): the queue -- its slots in memory and dlq.idx on the card -- is the worker's alone. The UI thread changes it only by a message (add, cancel, cancel all,
 * resume) that the worker applies in the order posted: at the top of its loop, inside a transfer (the transfer-info hook, about once a second or more) and after each track. So an add
 * and a cancel can never cross: whichever was posted last is what holds. What the UI thread reads (sba_dl_state, sba_dl_pending) is the slots with the waiting messages laid over them, so
 * a tap shows at once. The checks that only read (the guard, the card, the free space, a full queue) are still answered by sba_dl_add itself; what the card refuses when the worker
 * writes (a queue row, a cancel's line) is reported the way a failed transfer is, through sba_dl_failure.
 *
 * The manifest holds the track's whole row (title, artist, album, suffix, ...) plus the file name, so Downloaded works offline and with the server gone. It is a text file, one
 * track a line of tab-separated key=value fields (the keys are in sbd_row_text), replaced whole and atomically; a torn or odd line is skipped. A copy of (id, file, size, DSD)
 * stays in memory after the first use so that painting a row's state never touches the card; a file that was deleted by hand is found out (and dropped) when the path or the
 * list is asked for.
 *
 * Locks: sbd.job.lock guards the memory (slots, index, the message box) and is held for a few instructions only, never across a call; sbd.mf serialises the file work on dl.idx
 * (the worker's finished rows, the UI thread's deletes) and on dlq.idx (the worker, and the one first read, which may be the UI thread's); a waiting thread sleeps 1 ms at a time.
 * Order: mf, then the lock.
