"""Podcasts Discover (patch/pcjson.c pj_chart, patch/pcnet.c "Charts", patch/podcasts.c "Discover", docs/modules/podcasts.md "Discover"): Apple's top 25 shows and top 25 episodes of the Podcast Region.
The extractor against Python's json module on the sample answers (test/data/discover, fetched 2026-11-05), the worker (the request for each region, the retries, the 404 / empty fall back to the United States, the held
answers, the artwork one by one, Cancel, the guards, the lookup in the chart's store), and the level: geometry against tools/pod_show.py discover_layout, the Shows | Episodes control, the grey line under the title,
the lazy fetch of each chart, a tap on a row (show or episode: the lookup, the preview, Back to the chart), Not available, every failure in the page's words, the magnifier, the navbar, the screen-off rule and the
strings in 13 languages. The compiled payload runs under Unicorn; the card is a dict of paths and libcurl is scripted."""
