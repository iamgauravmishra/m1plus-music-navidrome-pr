"""The Add to Playlist picker (patch/picker.c, patch/playlists.c pick mode, docs/modules/picker.md): opened over a page that owns the stock list, it copies the list

through its own stock queries, adds with the stock batch_add_file as the stock row handler does (class, 0xf00b, the list, the selection, the playlist id), says the
